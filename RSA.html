This is my final project for<a href="http://www.cimat.mx/~alram/comp_algo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Introduction to Computer Science.</a>

The purpose of this project is to show how public key cryptography works and this is not, by any means, plausible for real-world usage.
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Generating primes for the keys.</strong></p>
I recently discovered that the <a href="https://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2010/04/18/the-sieve-of-sundaram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sieve of Sundaram </a>it's slightly faster than the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes"> sieve of Eratosthenes </a>while still being easy to implement and being deterministic. This sieving method allows me to generate a list with all primes below a number and we'll pick a number at random from that list.

The prime numbers that I'll generate are relatively small.
